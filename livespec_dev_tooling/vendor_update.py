"""vendor_update — re-vendor an upstream-sourced library into `_vendor/`.

Per the governed project's `SPECIFICATION/constraints.md` section "Vendoring
procedure": re-vendoring of upstream-sourced libs MUST go through `just
vendor-update <lib>` — the only blessed mutation path. The recipe fetches
the upstream ref recorded in `.vendor.jsonc`, copies the library's source
tree under the repo's own `_vendor/<lib>/`, preserves `LICENSE` (when
upstream ships one), and updates the entry's `vendored_at` timestamp.

## THE DESTINATION IS RESOLVED, NOT ASSUMED (`livespec-dev-tooling-w25v`)

The destination was once the literal `.claude-plugin/scripts/_vendor/`,
and that is one of THREE layouts the fleet actually uses: three
orchestrator/plugin repos vendor there, `livespec-driver-claude` vendors
at the repo ROOT, and this package vendors at
`livespec_dev_tooling/_vendor/`. So the blessed path was wrong in two of
the five repos carrying a vendored tree — including the one that SHIPS
it, which is why this repo's own three libs were placed by hand. It did
not fail: it created the wrong directory and exited 0, which is the
failure mode a "blessed only path" exists to prevent.

`_tracked_vendor_roots` reads the git index instead. A repo with NO
tracked `_vendor/` is REFUSED rather than given one: establishing a
first vendored tree is the one-time MANUAL procedure the same spec
section defines, and inventing a location for it here would be this
tool guessing a layout it just stopped guessing.

Note this is the same shape as the epic it was found under: machinery
correct for consumers and wrong or inert in the repo that owns it.

This is a maintainer-only mutating tool, invoked via `just vendor-update
<lib>` (NOT part of `just check`). Shim entries (`shim: true` in
`.vendor.jsonc`) are NOT re-vendored — they are livespec-authored and
edited in place via the normal propose-change cycle.

This module ships in the installed `livespec_dev_tooling` package (it was
relocated from livespec-core's `dev-tooling/vendor_update.py` so the
fleet's release→bump-pin automation can re-vendor in every consumer
repo: each governed project invokes `python -m
livespec_dev_tooling.vendor_update <lib>` from its own root, and the
manifest + vendor-destination paths resolve against the caller's `cwd`,
i.e. that consumer's `.vendor.jsonc` and its own resolved `_vendor/`
tree).

Output discipline: per spec, `print` (T20) and `sys.stderr.write`
(`check-no-write-direct`) are banned in the package. Diagnostics flow
through structlog (JSON to stderr); the package's vendored copy under
`livespec_dev_tooling/_vendor/structlog` is added to `sys.path` at module
import time.
