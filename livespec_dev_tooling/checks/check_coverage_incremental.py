"""check_coverage_incremental — path-scoped per-file 100% gate.

A path-scoped fast-feedback variant of `check-coverage` for the
Red→Green authoring loop. Invocation contract:

    just check-coverage-incremental --paths <impl_path> [<impl_path>...]

For each `<impl_path>` (repo-root-relative): resolve its
mirror-paired test path, then run pytest on the combined test
set with full `--cov` (no path filter — path-scoped `--cov=<dir>`
filters break under subprocess instrumentation because coverage's
`source=` resolves the relative path against the subprocess's cwd
at measurement time). Apply the per-file 100% line+branch gate via
`coverage report --include=<impl_paths> --fail-under=100`.

Both subprocess invocations always run; the script returns the
maximum of their return codes. This is intentional — running
both surfaces both failures simultaneously, which is the
fast-feedback role of v039 D3, and avoids the otherwise-untestable
"pytest failed, did we run coverage?" branch profile that would
require synthetic failing-test fixtures to exercise.

Wall-clock target: under 10 seconds for a typical single-file
pair. NOT a replacement for `check-coverage` — the full-tree
run remains the load-bearing pre-commit gate. The fast-feedback
role is to surface coverage gaps proactively during authoring,
BEFORE the Green amend triggers a multi-minute aggregate retry
on a missed defensive branch.

CLI-flag exemption note: the dev-tooling/checks/ CLAUDE.md
guidance reads "no CLI flags; the script reads the repo at
cwd." This script REQUIRES a `--paths` flag to scope the
per-file gate; the precedent is `red_green_replay.py` which
takes `argv[1]` as the COMMIT_EDITMSG path. The exemption is
documented at the v039 D3 canonical-target-list row.

Output discipline: per spec, `print` (T20) and
`sys.stderr.write` (`check-no-write-direct`) are banned in
dev-tooling/**. Diagnostics flow through structlog (JSON to
stderr); the vendored copy under `.claude-plugin/scripts/
_vendor/structlog` is added to `sys.path` at module import
time. Subprocess stdout/stderr (pytest's progress; coverage's
report) flows through to the developer's terminal unmodified
by NOT capturing it.
