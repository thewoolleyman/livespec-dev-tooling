"""per_file_coverage — every covered file at 100% line+branch coverage.

The authoritative coverage gate is **per-file** at 100% line
AND 100% branch — not just total. The existing
`[tool.coverage.report].fail_under = 100` setting in
pyproject.toml is preserved as a belt-and-braces total guard,
but the per-file gate is what fails first when any single
covered file slips below threshold.

Invocation context: this script runs AFTER `pytest --cov
--cov-branch` has produced a combined `.coverage` data file in
the repo's cwd. The justfile's `check-coverage` recipe
sequences pytest then this script. The script reads the
`.coverage` file via the `coverage` Python API (a uv-managed
dependency, NOT a vendored lib — `coverage` itself isn't part
of the shipped livespec runtime, only the dev-tooling test
infrastructure).

Cycle 1 implements the missing-line-coverage rejection: walks
all measured files, generates a JSON report via
`Coverage.json_report(outfile="-")` redirected to an in-memory
buffer, parses the JSON, and fails the first time any file's
`summary.percent_covered` is below 100%. Subsequent cycles
will tighten to also cover `summary.percent_covered_branches`
and to handle the no-data case explicitly.

Output discipline: per spec, `print` (T20) and
`sys.stderr.write` (`check-no-write-direct`) are banned in
dev-tooling/**. Diagnostics flow through structlog (JSON to
stderr); the vendored copy under `.claude-plugin/scripts/
_vendor/structlog` is added to `sys.path` at module import
time.
