"""Outside-in test for `dev-tooling/checks/per_file_coverage.py` — per-file 100% gate.

Every covered `.py` file MUST hit 100% line and 100% branch
coverage independently — not just total. This script supersedes
the totalize-only `[tool.coverage.report].fail_under = 100`
threshold by reading the `.coverage` data file (post-combine, as
produced by `pytest --cov --cov-branch`) and failing the first
time any single covered file drops below 100% on either axis.

This module holds the OUTERMOST behavioral test for that gate.
Cycle 1 pins the missing-line-coverage rejection: a synthetic
`subject.py` with five executable statements has only two
recorded as covered in the synthetic `.coverage` data file; the
check must exit non-zero and surface the offending source file
plus enough information to locate the gap. Subsequent cycles
will pin missing-branch-coverage rejection, the no-data case,
and the all-files-100% accept case.

The fixture builds a synthetic project root at `tmp_path` with
exactly one source file plus a hand-authored `.coverage` data
file produced via `coverage.CoverageData.add_lines` (writing
parallel-mode-disabled, single-file form so `Coverage.load()`
finds it directly without needing a `combine()` step). The check
is invoked as a subprocess with `cwd=tmp_path` per the standard
dev-tooling/checks invocation contract.
